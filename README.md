This project presents a **Power BI dashboard** that analyzes road accident data to uncover patterns and insights on total casualties, types of accidents, vehicle involvement, road types, light conditions, and more.

STEPS IN PROJECT
1.REQUIREMENT GATHERING
2.STAKEHOLDERS IN PROJECT
3.RAW DATA OVERVIEW
4.CONNECTING DATA WITH POWER BI
5.DATA CLEANING
6.DATA PROCESSING
7.DATA MODELLING
8.BACKGROUND DESIGN IN POWER PIVOT
9.DATA VISUALIZATION/CHARTS DESIGN
10.REPORT/DASHBOARD BUILDING
11.INSIGHTS

In this project i created primary kpi's
1.Total casualties and total accident values for current year and yoy growth.
2.Total casulaities by accident severity for current year and yoy growth.
Secondary kpi's
1.Total casualties with respect to vehicle type for current year.
* Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for current year and previous year.
* casulaities by road type for current year.
* current year casulaities by area/location by day/night.
  In this i used some power bi functionalities
  That is
  * How to connect to raw data/flat file.
  * Data cleaning in power query.
  * Data processing
  * Time intelligence functions/calender date table in power bi.
  * Data modelling(relationship between multiple tables).
  * YTD and YOY Growth calculations in DAX.
  * KPI and advanced KPI generations.
  * Creating custom columns and measure in the reports.
  * Importing images.
  * Creating different charts and generating insights.

  ## üìä Dashboard Features

- **Total Casualties, Accidents, and Severity Types**
- Casualties breakdown by:
  - üöó Vehicle Type
  - üõ£Ô∏è Road Type
  - ‚òÄÔ∏è Light Condition
  - üèôÔ∏è Urban vs Rural Area
  - üìâ Monthly Trend Analysis (Current vs Previous Year)
 
    ## üß† Insights

- Majority of casualties involve **cars** and occur on **single carriageways**.
- Most accidents happen during **daylight**, and in **urban areas**.
- A clear decline in serious and fatal casualties can be observed year-over-year.

  ## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **DAX** for measures
- **Custom Visuals** (Doughnut, Line, Bar, etc.)
- Data Cleaning & Modeling in Power BI.

- Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard provides a clear and interactive view of road accident trends and severity levels. By visualizing key metrics such as vehicle type, road conditions, and time-based comparisons, stakeholders can better understand accident patterns and identify critical areas for road safety improvement. This project showcases practical skills in data modeling, visualization, and storytelling using Power BI ‚Äî essential for data analyst roles.
